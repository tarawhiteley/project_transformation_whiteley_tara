## Resources

I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

### Deductions
I have reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

#### Comments

The biggest challenge I had with this assignment was limiting the number of changes I made before committing the changes. It was also difficult to know where to start. I wanted to bounce back and forth between html and css, but was trying not to so that I could make appropriate commits.
